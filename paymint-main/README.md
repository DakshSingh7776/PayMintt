## Overview

PayMint solves the problem of delayed payments for small and medium businesses (SMEs) by converting invoices into NFTs on the **Stacks blockchain**. Businesses can sell these invoice NFTs to lenders, unlocking instant cash flow, while lenders earn a safe, low-risk profit. All rules—discounts, settlements, defaults—are automatically enforced using **Clarity smart contracts**.

## Features

- **Invoice Generator (Web2-friendly)** → SMEs and freelancers can easily create and upload invoices with simple email/password login (via Supabase).  
- **Bitcoin-secured Marketplace (Web3)** → Invoices are tokenized as NFTs on Stacks, with funding, settlement, and interest handled transparently by Clarity smart contracts.  
- **Leather Wallet Integration** → Businesses and lenders connect their Stacks wallet to fund or settle invoices securely.  
- **Instant Liquidity** → Lenders can fund invoices and earn 2–5% interest when invoices are repaid.  
- **KYC/KYB & Compliance** → Built-in verification (e.g., GSTIN ensures every business is legitimate and invoices are authentic).

## How It Works

1. **Invoice NFT Creation**: Businesses create invoices using the Web2 interface and mint them as NFTs on the Stacks blockchain.  
2. **Funding**: Lenders browse the marketplace and fund invoices, providing instant liquidity to the business.  
3. **Settlement**: When the customer pays the invoice, the Clarity smart contract automatically transfers funds to the lender.  
4. **Verification**: GST validation, KYC/KYB checks, and smart contract rules ensure secure, fair transactions.  
5. **Fractional Lending**: Multiple lenders can fund a single invoice, splitting profits safely and transparently.
