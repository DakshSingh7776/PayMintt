# 🚀 Clarity Smart Contract Demonstration Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide shows you how to demonstrate the **Invoice Factoring Smart Contract** using Clarinet. The contract enables:

1. **Businesses** to create invoices
2. **Lenders** to fund invoices  
3. **Automatic settlement** when businesses repay

## 🏗️ Contract Architecture

### Core Functions

```clarity
;; 1. Create Invoice
(create-invoice (amount uint) (due-date uint))
→ Returns: (ok invoice-id)

;; 2. Fund Invoice  
(fund-invoice (invoice-id uint) (amount uint))
→ Returns: (ok true)

;; 3. Settle Invoice
(settle-invoice (invoice-id uint))
→ Returns: (ok true)
```

### Invoice States

```clarity
STATUS_CREATED = 0  ;; Invoice created, waiting for funding
STATUS_FUNDED  = 1  ;; Invoice funded by lender
STATUS_SETTLED = 2  ;; Invoice settled (business repaid)
```

## 🎯 Demo Script

### Step 1: Setup Clarinet Environment

```bash
# Navigate to contract directory
cd paymint-invoice-factoring

# Check contract syntax
clarinet check

# Start Clarinet console
clarinet console
```

### Step 2: Demo Flow

#### **Scene 1: Business Creates Invoice**

```clarity
;; Business creates a $1000 invoice due in 30 days
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFYVWEQ30FH8Y6KVVK3R4B1YX1S1.invoice-factoring create-invoice u1000000000 u100)

;; Expected Result: (ok u1)
;; Invoice ID: 1
;; Status: Created
;; Amount: 1000 STX (1,000,000,000 microSTX)
;; Due Date: Block 100
```

**Demo Points:**
- ✅ Invoice created successfully
- ✅ Unique invoice ID generated
- ✅ Business address recorded
- ✅ Status set to "Created"

#### **Scene 2: Lender Funds Invoice**

```clarity
;; Lender funds the invoice with $1000
(contract-call? 'ST2J8EVYHPJBYJ3M7V0X7FCPCHJ6WZTBQ8MF9S4V8.invoice-factoring fund-invoice u1 u1000000000)

;; Expected Result: (ok true)
;; Invoice Status: Funded
;; Lender: ST2J8EVYHPJBYJ3M7V0X7FCPCHJ6WZTBQ8MF9S4V8
;; STX Transfer: 1000 STX → Business
```

**Demo Points:**
- ✅ STX transferred from lender to business
- ✅ Invoice status updated to "Funded"
- ✅ Lender address recorded
- ✅ Funded amount tracked

#### **Scene 3: Business Settles Invoice**

```clarity
;; Business repays the lender
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFYVWEQ30FH8Y6KVVK3R4B1YX1S1.invoice-factoring settle-invoice u1)

;; Expected Result: (ok true)
;; Invoice Status: Settled
;; STX Transfer: 1000 STX → Lender
;; Complete lifecycle achieved
```

**Demo Points:**
- ✅ STX transferred from business back to lender
- ✅ Invoice status updated to "Settled"
- ✅ Complete invoice lifecycle demonstrated

### Step 3: Query Functions

#### **Check Invoice Counter**
```clarity
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFYVWEQ30FH8Y6KVVK3R4B1YX1S1.invoice-factoring get-invoice-counter)
;; Returns: u1 (total invoices created)
```

#### **Get Invoice Details**
```clarity
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFYVWEQ30FH8Y6KVVK3R4B1YX1S1.invoice-factoring get-invoice-details u1)
;; Returns: Invoice data structure
```

## 🔄 Complete Demo Workflow

### **Demo Script for Presentation:**

```
"Let me demonstrate our Invoice Factoring Smart Contract on Stacks blockchain.

First, I'll show you how a business creates an invoice:
- Business creates a $1000 invoice due in 30 days
- Contract generates unique invoice ID
- Invoice status: Created

Next, a lender funds the invoice:
- Lender transfers 1000 STX to business
- Invoice status: Funded
- Lender address recorded

Finally, business settles the invoice:
- Business repays 1000 STX to lender
- Invoice status: Settled
- Complete lifecycle achieved

This demonstrates:
✅ Automated escrow functionality
✅ Transparent transaction history
✅ Immutable invoice records
✅ Trustless business relationships
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Smart Contract Features:**

1. **Data Storage**
   - Invoice counter (auto-incrementing)
   - Invoice details map
   - Status tracking

2. **STX Transfers**
   - Direct peer-to-peer transfers
   - No centralized escrow
   - Transparent on blockchain

3. **State Management**
   - Status transitions
   - Address tracking
   - Amount validation

### **Error Handling:**

```clarity
(err u1)  ;; Invalid amount
(err u2)  ;; Invalid due date  
(err u3)  ;; Invoice not found
(err u4)  ;; Invalid status for funding
(err u5)  ;; Amount exceeds invoice
(err u6)  ;; Transfer failed
(err u7)  ;; Invalid status for settlement
(err u8)  ;; Unauthorized settlement
(err u9)  ;; Repayment transfer failed
(err u10) ;; No lender found
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits Demonstrated

### **For Businesses:**
- ✅ Immediate cash flow from invoices
- ✅ No credit checks required
- ✅ Transparent fee structure

### **For Lenders:**
- ✅ Direct investment in invoices
- ✅ Automated repayment
- ✅ Transparent risk assessment
